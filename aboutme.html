                    You should hire me because I'm awesome. The bee's knees, you might say. Will I do an awesome job coding your website? Debatable. Will I make it look pretty and mostly function AND make you feel smart for having hired me? You bet I will. Do you see those trees in the background? I made those. You can't get that kind of quality elsewhere.
